title: REPL + AVM Interpreter
description: The Aura Virtual Machine and the Z3 safety gate.
---

## AVM

`aura-interpret` provides a lightweight execution engine (AVM) for rapid iteration.

It supports:

- evaluating Aura source from stdin
- returning a JSON result for editor integration

## Z3 safety gate

By default, the interpreter uses a Z3-backed verification step as a hard gate: if the program doesn’t verify, it won’t execute.

## Dynamic plugin loading

The interpreter can enable plugins dynamically based on imports in the source:

- `import aura-ai` enables the AI plugin checks
- `import aura-iot` enables the IoT plugin checks

If no plugin imports are present, the interpreter defaults to running with both built-in plugins.
