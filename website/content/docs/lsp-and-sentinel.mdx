title: LSP + Aura Sentinel (VS Code)
description: Plugin-aware diagnostics, overlays, and live proof feedback in the editor.
---

## Components

- **`aura-lsp`** computes diagnostics by parsing, type-checking, then verifying with Z3.
- **Aura Sentinel** (VS Code extension) runs `aura-lsp` and renders additional UX.

Protocol reference: `/docs/sentinel-protocol`.

See also: **Lumina Sentinel** for proof-driven UI rendering and span-accurate geometry failures: `/docs/lumina-sentinel`.

## Plugin-aware diagnostics

When verification succeeds, plugins may emit **informational** diagnostics that attribute the proof to a plugin id and (optionally) include:

- exact SMT formula used in the proof
- related information pointing to the enabling `aura.toml` entry
- structured fields like `mask` and `range`

## Sentinel overlays

Aura Sentinel renders Nexus proof diagnostics as:

- gutter icons for verified lines (IoT chip / AI neural)
- hover text showing mask/range + SMT
- a sidebar “Nexus Plugins” view listing active plugins and trust state
- inlay hints for IoT verified ranges

## How to run (dev)

In this repo:

- VS Code extension: `editors/vscode`
- LSP binary: built from the workspace (`cargo build -p aura-lsp`)

Typical workflow:

1. Open `editors/vscode` in VS Code
2. Run “Run and Debug” (Extension Development Host)
3. Open an `.aura` file in the new window
