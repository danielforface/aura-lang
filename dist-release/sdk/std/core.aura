# AuraSDK stdlib: std::core
# Minimal “complete feeling” core module for the current prototype.
# This is intentionally tiny: it exists to make `import std::core` meaningful.
#
# NOTE: many advanced features (Option/Result, iterators) are roadmap items
# and will land once the language has enums + pattern ergonomics in the std.

# Core utilities
trusted extern cell panic(msg: String) -> Unit

# Basic formatting/logging
trusted extern cell debug(msg: String) -> Unit
