## Shape-safe tensors

Aura supports tensor types that carry shape information.

<Example title="A tensor with a static shape">

```aura
import aura::tensor

val input: Tensor<u32, [2, 2, 3]> = tensor::new<u32>(12)
```

</Example>

<Semantics title="What gets proven">
The checker treats <Ty>Tensor&lt;T, [d1, d2, ...]&gt;</Ty> as a value whose shape is part of the type. Verification can then prove that reshape / inference calls never mismatch shapes.
</Semantics>

## ONNX inference

Load a model and infer:

<Example title="Inference with a shape-safe output">

```aura
import onnxruntime

val model: Model = ai.load_model("identity_u32_2x2x3.onnx")
val out: Tensor<u32, [2, 2, 3]> = model.infer(input)
```

</Example>

The verifier checks that the model’s expected input shape matches the provided tensor shape.

<Note>
This page describes the high-level surface syntax. The plugin-aware verifier emits informational diagnostics like “verified by aura-ai” in the editor (Aura Sentinel).
