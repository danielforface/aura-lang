title: Aura IoT Plugin
description: Hardware/MMIO safety checks (capabilities, offsets, bitmasks).
---

## Enable

Add this to your `aura.toml`:

```toml
plugins = [
  { name = "aura-iot", trusted = true },
]
```

## What it verifies

- Emits informational proof diagnostics for verified bitmask/offset facts.
- Uses the nearest aura.toml [hardware] manifest to learn register masks.

## Example

```aura
import aura::hw

cell main() ->:
    val cap = hw.open("SPI_CTRL")
    val _ = hw.write_u32(cap, 0, 0x3FF)
```

## Editor feedback

When verification succeeds, the LSP publishes informational diagnostics tagged with the plugin id (`aura-iot`). Aura Sentinel uses these to render gutter icons, hovers, and inlay hints.
