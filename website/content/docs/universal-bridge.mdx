description: How Aura swallows C/C++ libraries via generated extern shims.

## Bridging

Aura can generate extern shims from C headers.

- Declare the header(s) in `aura.toml`
- Aura generates a bridge module during build
- The linker pulls only the requested artifacts

This keeps the project “git clone → aura run” self-healing.
