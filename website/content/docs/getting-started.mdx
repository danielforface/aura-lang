description: Build Aura from this repo and run your first verified program.
---

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Z3 (if you want verification enabled)

## First run

Create a file:

```aura
cell main() -> u32:
  val x: u32 = 42
  yield x
```

Then run:

```sh
cargo run -p aura --features z3 -- build main.aura --mode avm --backend c
```

If Z3 is enabled, verification is a hard gate.

## Projects and `aura.toml`

Aura looks for an `aura.toml` by searching upward from the source file. This is where you enable Nexus plugins:

```toml
plugins = [
  { name = "aura-ai", trusted = true },
  { name = "aura-iot", trusted = true },
]
```
