# Release notes

## Unreleased

- Debug protocol: `hello` capabilities, `terminate` works for native + Dev-VM, `terminated` event.
- Native runs: supervised execution avoids orphan processes; stdout forwarding is serialized with debug events.
- Perf: richer `perfReport.memory` breakdown and UI helptext for common keys.
