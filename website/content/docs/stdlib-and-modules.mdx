title: Stdlib, Modules, and Imports
description: How Aura uses imports and module namespaces in the current prototype.

## Imports as module placeholders

Today, Aura uses `import` primarily to register well-known module namespaces.

When installed as the AuraSDK, Aura also uses `import aura::...` as a trigger to
auto-inject the corresponding stdlib module from `AURA_HOME/std` (or, in the dev
repo, `sdk/std`). This keeps beginner workflows simple while preserving stable
diagnostic spans.

Examples:

```aura
import aura::io
import aura::tensor
import aura::hw
```

This enables expressions like:

- `io.display(x)`
- `tensor::new<u32>(n)`
- `hw.open("SPI_CTRL")`

## Known namespaces

Common built-ins:

- `io`: printing/display
- `tensor`: tensor construction and element ops
- `ai`: model loading and inference (usually via the `aura-ai` plugin)
- `hw`: hardware/capability operations (via the `aura-iot` plugin)

## Bridge modules

When using the Universal Bridge, you may import modules that are backed by native headers/libraries declared in `aura.toml`.

See “The Universal Bridge” for how headers and linking are configured.
